## Keypoints
### Chapter 3
- Three main categories of widgets are: structure and navigation; displaying
information; and, positioning widgets
- Two main visual design systems available in Flutter, Material and
Cupertino
- Using the Material theme, WE can build quite varied user interface elements to
give your app a custom look and feel
- It’s generally a good idea to establish a common theme object for the app, giving
you a single source of truth for app’s style
- The Scaffold widget implements all basic visual layout structure needs
- The Container widget can be used to group other widgets together
- The Container widget can be used to group other widgets together
### Chapter 4
- Flutter maintains three trees in parallel: the Widget, Element and RenderObject
trees.
- A Flutter app only updates the widgets that needs redrawing.
- The Flutter Inspector is a useful tool to debug, experiment with and inspect a
widget tree.
- always start by creating StatelessWidgets, only use
StatefulWidgets state of the widget needs to be managed.
- Inherited widgets are a good solution to access state from the top of the tree.
