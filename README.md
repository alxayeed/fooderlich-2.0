## Keypoints
- ListView and GridView support both horizontal and vertical scroll directions.
- The primary property lets Flutter know which scroll view is the primary scroll
view.
- physics in a scroll view lets you change the user scroll interaction.
- Especially in a nested list view, remember to set shrinkWrap to true so you can
give the scroll view a fixed height for all the items in the list.
- Use a FutureBuilder to wait for an asynchronous task to complete.
- we can nest scrollable widgets. For example, we can place a grid view within a
list view.
- Use ScrollController and ScrollNotification to control or listen to scroll
behavior.
- Barrel files are handy to group imports together. They also let you import many
widgets using a single file.
