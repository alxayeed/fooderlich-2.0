## Stacks

- Dart
- Flutter



## Keypoints
- We can wrap another router in a containing widget.
- Navigator 1.0 is useful for quick and simple prototypes, presenting alerts and
dialogs.
- Navigator 2.0 is useful when we need more control and organization when
managing the navigation stack.
- In Navigator 2.0, the navigator widget holds a list of MaterialPage objects.
- we can use a router widget to listen to navigation state changes and configure our
navigator’s list of pages.
- Setting the router’s Back button dispatcher lets us listen to platform system
events.
